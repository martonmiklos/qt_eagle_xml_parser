# qt_eagle_xml_parser
A Qt class to parse Autodesk EAGLE Schematics/PCBs/libraries.

Autogenerated from the eagle.dtd* shipped with EAGLE 9.1.3 with [KODE](https://github.com/martonmiklos/kode "KODE")

As of today it is possible to parse and save an EAGLE design without making the EAGLE to claim about missing/malformed stuff.

*[see tools/generate.sh for the tricks](../../blob/master/tools/generate.sh)
